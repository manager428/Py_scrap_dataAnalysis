An idea for how to practice this: in your next team brainstorm, instead of defining all the reasons an idea won’t work, try listing all the reasons it might work. 3.  : “Everyone in the world is better than you at something.” The smartest people always know that they’re not the smartest person, and stay open to constructive feedback (from anyone - not just their superiors) as a tool for continuous growth. The humility to receive feedback without becoming defensive or pointing fingers is crucial to YO’s culture. And of course, feedback should always be given following the “Radical Candor” style. (Radical Candor is required reading!)  4.  : When in doubt, overcommunicate. Imagine how many problems in the world have been caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings caused by less-than-perfect communication. We’ve all been there - you walk away from an interaction thinking that the other person understood you perfectly, yet find out a few days later that they had a completely different takeaway of the conversation as you did. This is especially a challenge for globally distributed teams who work in several different languages and time zones.

Senior Python Developer at C-Change Labs,"We are looking for solid software engineers. Our company was founded by an engineer, is run by engineers, and works with the most advanced construction software. You are interested in learning from and cooperating with talented colleagues. You love sharing value by producing beautiful and clean APIs. You enjoy engineering as a whole — complex scalable systems, performance optimization and direct product impact. Working at C-Change is not only an opportunity to wield great tools tackling complex problems. It is a rare opportunity to make a direct, visible impact affecting our future — by fighting climate change with science and data. Computer Science - Algorithms and data structures: You understand common data structures and algorithms, you are able to evaluate them and apply appropriately to the given situation, and evaluate algorithm complexity. - OOP and Patterns: You must understand what is SOLID, Domain Driven Design, and IoC. You must know how to use common patterns and design REST services. Python \ Backend - Good understanding of the language and its potential (generators, lambda, decorators, etc.). Practical Python development experience is required. - Understanding of language peculiarities and environment runtime (types, multiple threads, etc.). - You can write typed code and understand why it helps in the development. You can use types as an effective tool to describe a domain area. - Frameworks: Beneficial, but not required that you have an understanding of how Django Framework, Celery, and Django REST Framework work. General IT skills and competencies - Client-server architecture. At least basic understanding of networks (dns, http, tcp). - Debug: Effective troubleshooting and using modern debug tools. - Refactoring. - Error processing: Application exceptions are handled competently and uniformly. You must know the difference between error flow and exception flow. - Documenting your code. - You must know how to write extensible code. - You can break tasks into smaller units, provide planning and estimates. - You know how to use a version control system and understand how to interact with a repository when working with your team. - You can read and understand code written by other people. Intermediate English C-Change Labs is an unusual company. We fight carbon emissions to make our world a better and safer place — and we do it with technology and science. We help the construction ecosystem accelerate its shift to sustainability with our EC3 tool, described as “the Tesla of sustainability” at COP26, which we develop for the non-profit BuildingTransparency.org. Our policy of free access, open APIs, and solid science has made BuildingTransparency and C-Change Labs the partners of choice for global firms with sustainability goals in construction. We build tools for construction ecosystem to have visibility into carbon emissions and sustainability side of things. For example, with our tool an architects bureau can keep in mind what is the environmental footprint of their new project, or a construction conglomerate can see into details of how this very steel bar they use has been produced. Has it been produced burning coal in ineffective small-scale factories, or with cleaner, more modern process? How does this choice affect the cost? What can be the benefit? And this is the question we want them to ask. With this kind of question the sustainability and environmental factors of the construction are getting into the agenda and become weighing factors. C-Change Labs provides data for this where and when it is needed. Professional Growth We maintain an open culture. Achievements are appreciated; achievements over your role and helping your co-workers succeed are key to advancement. Mistakes are expected, and are to be openly discussed and learned from. Honesty is an absolute requirement. You will be surrounded by a group of passionate engineers who are happy to participate in technical discussions. Access to advice: You need it — you ask for it. People around will help. We expect you to help your co-workers in the same way. There will be opportunities to lead projects, mentor junior devs, and expand your skill-set if desired. Working Space We are an all-remote team so there is no traditional office space. However we will be happy to help you organize an effective working space: - We will provide a decent workstation (laptop, monitor, accessories, software) and any necessary equipment (e.g. desk, chair) for you to work safely and comfortably. - If you prefer to work from an office, we will cover reasonable co-working expenses. Health & Wellness We offer competitive benefits for all staff. They are structured differently in each country; in Canada we offer extended health and dental benefits through Manulife. Time We encourage a healthy work/life balance: we do not believe routine overtime is a good way to do business. All roles get at least three weeks paid time off, as well as paid sick leave. Money Competitive compensation matching the market. Compensation reviews are tied to your growth and improvement Short Decision Making Chain Every team member is a direct contact with CEO and CTO so there is no long decision making process and it is easy to escalate issue if any.
